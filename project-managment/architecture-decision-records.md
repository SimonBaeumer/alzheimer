# Architecture decision records (ADR)

ADRs are a nice and clean way to document design decision. You can use [this CLI tool](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for working with ADRs.

I like ADRs because you can simply store them into the VCS of your choice and keep track of the decision for any given state of your app.
